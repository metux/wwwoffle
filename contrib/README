Note: I did not write or check all of these scripts, they were supplied to me by
      the authors named below.


Debian Startup (I)
------------------

Filename:    debian1/wwwoffle
Contributed: Joerg Wittenberger <Joerg.Wittenberger@inf.tu-dresden.de>

> [The script is] Usually called like the system those belong to, e.g., 'bind',
> 'nfs', 'apache'; `wwwoffle' would be a good choice.
>
> Those script go into the `init.d' directory. It's usually either
> '/etc/init.d' because it comprises the system configuration or under
> '/sbin/init.d', or '/usr/sbin/init.d' because to be exact only
> symlinks within the rc<runlevel>.d are the actual config data.


Debian Startup (II)
-------------------

Filename:    debian2/wwwoffle
Contributed: Remo Petritoli <petritoli@iol.it>

This is a modified version of the one above with some extra features.


Redhat Startup
--------------

Filenames:   redhat1/wwwoffled
             redhat1/ip-up.local redhat1/ip-down.local
Contributed: Vikram Goyal <viki@bol.net.in>

This is a modified version of the file above.

> 1) wwwoffled :
> 
> This is for dir /etc/rc.d/init.d/. If put there and command 
> chkconfig -add wwwoffled is executed, then the program will integrate with
> starting and stopping of the o.s. i.e it will become like rest of the services
> provided in the distro. The script will start the program and create a pidfile
> in /var/run also put a file 'wwwwoffled' in /var/lock/subsys. All this is for
> RedHat. The script also gives other options (like reloading a new config file)
> which you can check with command /sbin/service wwwoffled <ENTER> after doing
> the above steps i.e making it an o.s service. Of course all this can be done 
> without wwwoffled service script but this way wwwoffled has a neater interface
> of usage.
> 
> 2) ip-up.local and ip-down.local :
> 
> These should be in dir /etc/ppp/.
> They are called automatically by ip-up and ip-down respectively
> when there is a successful ppp connection and when connection is terminated.
> 
> 2a) ip-up.local :
> 
> As you may see it will put wwwoffled in online mode if running else
> start it and then put it in online mode after pppd is a success.
> 
> 2b) ip-down.local :
> 
> It will put wwwoffled in offline mode after the ppp connection has
> terminated.
> 
> Both ip-up.local and ip-down.local use wwwoffled service script. So they
> can be used properly only after wwwoffled has been made an o.s service.



Slackware Startup (or other BSD style system)
---------------------------------------------

Filename:    bsd/rc.local
Contributed: Andrew M. Bishop <amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk> [WWWOFFLE Author]

If you have a Slackware system (or other BSD style system) then you can start
wwwoffled by putting it in the rc.local file.  The bsd/rc.local file
should be appended to the /etc/rc.d/rc.local (or /etc/rc.local) file.

It is not important that the wwwoffled demon is killed when the computer is
shutdown.


S.u.S.E. Startup
----------------

Filename:    suse/wwwoffle
Contributed: Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@westend.com>

> this is the file and the links I am using to start/stop wwwoffled
> during boot/shutdown of my machine (distribution is `S.u.S.e 4.4.1`).
> 
> rc2.d/K18wwwoffle -> ../wwwoffle
> rc2.d/S18wwwoffle -> ../wwwoffle
> rc3.d/K18wwwoffle -> ../wwwoffle
> rc3.d/S18wwwoffle -> ../wwwoffle


PPPD Start and Stop
-------------------

Filenames:   ppp/ip-up & ppp/ip-down
Contributed: Andrew M. Bishop <amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk> [WWWOFFLE Author]

If you use PPP then there will be scripts that the pppd program will run when
the link is connected and before it is disconnected.  These can be used to set
the wwwoffled demon online and offline automatically and to fetch the pages that
have been requested.

The file ppp/ip-up should be appended to the /etc/ppp/ip-up file and the
ppp/ip-down file should be appended to the /etc/ppp/ip-down file.


Post WWWOFFLE Script
--------------------

Filename:    auto/post-wwwoffle.sh
Contributed: Andrew M. Bishop <amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk> [WWWOFFLE Author]

If this script is run after WWWOFFLE is taken offline it will examine the files
that were downloaded while online and can be used to display them.


WWWOFFLE Usage monitoring
-------------------------

Filename:    logfile/audit-usage.pl
Contributed: Andrew M. Bishop <amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk> [WWWOFFLE Author]

This script can be run on the WWWOFFLE logfile created by running WWWOFFLE with
debugging output enabled.  It will report the URLs that were requested, what
mode the wwwoffled program is in, which host the request came from and which
user requested them if AllowedConnectUsers section of the configuration file is
used.

Running wwwoffled as shown below gives a logfile with the information required.

wwwoffled -d 4 >  wwwoffled.log 2>&1    # sh/bash Shells
wwwoffled -d 4 >& wwwoffled.log         # csh/tcsh Shells


ISP Configuration
-----------------

Filename:    config/wwwoffle-config.pl
Contributed: Christian Zagrodnick <zagy@vodoo.boerde.de>

# With wwwoffle-config you can have different configurations for wwwoffle
# in one single file. 
#
# There are two ways of configuring now: `#//+' and `#//-'
# With #//+ the leading `#' in the NEXT line will be removed.
# With #//- the next line will be preceeded with a `#'


Log File PID Search
-------------------

Filename:    logfile/log-pid.pl
Contributed: Andrew M. Bishop <amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk> [WWWOFFLE Author]

A Perl script to parse the WWWOFFLE log file output and find all references to
the specified PID for debugging purposes.

Usage: log-pid.pl <pid> < wwwoffle.log


KPPP Scripts
------------

Filename:    kppp/kppp-online, kppp/kppp-offline
Contributed: Antonio Larrosa <antlarr@arrakis.es>

> In the "Execute" tab of the account setup, the "Upon connect" application
> should be :
> konsole -e <path>/kppp-online
> and the "Upon disconnect" application should be:
> konsole -e <path>/kppp-offline
> 
> where kppp-online and kppp-offline are the attached scripts
> 
> you could also call "kppp-online" directly, but then it would be executed on the
> background and the user wouldn't see the standard output (while fetching pages) 


Mark URLs not to be purged
--------------------------

Filename:    purge/url2keep
Contributed: Jörg Mensmann <joerg.mensmann@gmx.net>

> Here is a new version of "url2keep" (formally known as
> "permcache-netscape.pl"). It now not only works with Netscape's
> bookmarks but has become more flexible.
> 
> Thanks to Jacques L'helgoualc'h <lhh@free.fr> for improving the script
> so that it now works as a filter. It parses HTML code read from stdin
> and outputs all links found there in a format which can be read by the
> config file. See the comments in script for further documentation.


Alternative Cache-Info HTML
---------------------------

Filename:    messages1/AddCacheInfo.html
Contributed: Luis Miguel Ferreira <ferreira@iname.com>

> I changed the AddCacheInfo.html page, I tweaked it a bit, so that now the
> items on it have a fixed colour and background (they're inside a table), and I
> added an option do delete the host site (delete all pages on that site).
> (on some web pages, these links were invisible, because they were of the same
> colour as the background, that's why I changed it)

You need to replace the file /var/cache/wwwoffle/html/messages/AddCacheInfo.html
with the file supplied here and enable the add-cache-info option in the
ModifyHTML section of the configuration file.


Netscape Javascript Bookmarks
-----------------------------

Filename:    bookmarklets/bookmarks.html
Contributed: Joerg Mensmann <joerg.mensmann@gmx.de>

> I always felt that using WWWOFFLE's extended features like monitor or
> recursive fetch were to complicated to use. For using them I usually had
> to a open a new Netscape window, there moving to the appropriate control
> page and finally copying the URL from the original window into the
> WWWOFFLE form.
> 
> The "add-cache-info"-feature is a solution for this problem, but it
> often messes up layout, especially when frames are used.
> 
> The same can be accomplished using "bookmarklets" (small javascripts
> stored in bookmarks) without those problems.
> 
> To use it, ... in Netscape Bookmarks do
> File/Import. Of course, javascript has to be enabled and you might have
> to adjust "localhost:8080" to where your WWWOFFLE is running.

This will create a new bookmark folder with the extra WWWOFFLE features in it.
These each apply to the currently viewed page.

It is possible to copy the bookmarks into the "Personal Toolbar Folder" and the
bookmarks are then available directly from the personal toolbar instead of the
bookmark menu.

I (AMB) added some other bookmarks to those provided that allows a recursive
fetch of all pages linked to from the current page, monitoring the current page,
information about the current page and configuration file editing for the
current page.


Netscape Javascript Bookmarks & Alternative Cache-Info HTML
-----------------------------------------------------------

Filenames:   messages2/bookmarks.html & messages2/AddCacheInfo.html
Contributed: Dag Hoidahl <dag.hoidahl@fix.no>

> I have made a few small bookmarklets (JavaScript snippets to put in the
> bookmark file) that are useful with WWWOFFLE. They provide bookmarks for
> the Delete, Refresh, Monitor, Index and Fetch commands. This way, those
> commands are always available without having to modify the cached pages.
> 
> I also made a replacement AddCacheInfo.html file that stores the cache
> info in a JavaScript variable, so it can be shown in an alertbox using a
> bookmarklet.
> 
> The attached bookmarks file is for Netscape Navigator, but the
> JavaScript is basic enough for it to work on any JavaScript-enabled
> browser, I believe. If you use Netscape, you can just import the
> bookmarks and put them somewhere easy to reach, for instance in the
> Toolbar folder. Otherwise you could open the file and add the links as
> bookmarks manually.

You need to replace the file /var/cache/wwwoffle/html/messages/AddCacheInfo.html
with the file supplied here and enable the add-cache-info option in the
ModifyHTML section of the configuration file.


DontGet List Converter
----------------------

Filenames:   dontget/README dontget/*
Contributed: Andrew M. Bishop <amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk> [WWWOFFLE Author]

There are many other programs available that can be used to block adverts and
other URLs.  Examples include Junkbuster and SquidGuard.  The authors or users
of these programs publish lists of URLs and hostnames that can be used by these
programs.

The README file in the dontget directory contains a few places to get these
lists from and the other files in the directory convert these lists to the
format that WWWOFFLE can use.


Example entries for the DontGet section
---------------------------------------

Filename:    dontget/DontGet.txt
Contributed: Andrew M. Bishop <amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk> [WWWOFFLE Author]

This file is the latest version of the DontGet.txt file that is also available
from http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/wwwoffle/version-2.7/DontGet.txt.


Invoke wwwoffle from emacs to request URLs
------------------------------------------

Filename:    emacs/browse-wwwoffle.el
Contributed: Andrew M. Bishop <amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk> [WWWOFFLE Author]

Emacs allows URLs to be selected and opened in a web browser.  If you want
replace this function with the ability to request URLs using WWWOFFLE instead of
browsing them then the emacs lisp will help.


Dan Jacobson's WWWOFFLE tools
-----------------------------

Webpage:     http://jidanni.org/comp/wwwoffle/
Contributed: Dan Jacobson <jidanni@jidanni.org>

Dan Jacobson has made several tools for WWWOFFLE.  These do a number of
different things, for example delete requests from the outgoing directory and
cache by regexp or chop the WWWOFFLE lasttime index into parts.


An example CGI script, useful for testing CGI interfaces
--------------------------------------------------------

Filename:    cgi/testscript.pl
Contributed: Paul A. Rombouts <p.a.rombouts@home.nl>

This script is an example Perl script that can be used for testing the WWWOFFLE
CGI interface.


An example spec file for creating RPMs
--------------------------------------

Filename:    redhat1/spec
Contributed: Richard Zidlicky <rz@linux-m68k.org>

This file is a spec file that can be used for building RPMs of WWWOFFLE.


Redhat spec files and startup files
-----------------------------------

Filename:    redhat2/README (for instructions)
Contributed: Andrew Bray <andy@chaos.org.uk>

> Here is a set of files you might consider including in the standard
> distribution. It gets a lot smaller if you chop out DontGet.txt and 
> wwwoffle_hints-tips.txt, as the README includes instructions for 
> recreating them.

(I have included the latest version of DontGet.txt separately, see above.)


A spec file for creating RPMs for Redhat 9
------------------------------------------

Filename:    redhat3/wwwoffle.spec
Contributed: Davide Bolcioni <dbolcion@libero.it>

A spec file for creating RPMs of WWWOFFLE version 2.8a for Redhat 9.


Wildcard wwwoffle-ls
--------------------

Filename:    wwwoffle-ls2
Contributed: Marc Boucher <marcb@box100.com>

> Here is an alternative to wwwoffle-ls that accepts URLs with wildcards.
> 
> Examples:
> 
>   wwwoffle-ls2  http://*yahoo*/*.php
>   wwwoffle-ls2  *://*freshmeat.net/*.php
> 
> The main problem was that it takes an eternity to check (read) all U* files
> in the matched directories. My solution is to write a listing file in each
> host's dir. This file is read instead of every U* file and is only
> rewritten if the mdate of the directory is younger than the file.
> For this reason the user must be root or have write access to the spool
> directories.

>  - If your spool dir is not "/var/cache/wwwoffle/" you can use '-c configfile'
>    to read it from your configuration file.
> See -h for more information.
> 
> I have also included a patch to prevent WWWOFFLE from deleting valid
> listing files when purging the cache.


Checking Duplicated Monitored Files
-----------------------------------

Filename:    duplicates/*
Contributed: Andrew M. Bishop <amb@gedanken.demon.co.uk> [WWWOFFLE Author]

If a particular URL is monitored on a daily basis it may be seen that the same
URL is always fetched even though there seems to be no change.  Provided are two
scripts that can help find out why the page was re-fetched.  There is a README
file in the duplicates directory that gives more details.


WWWOFFLE Book - Creating a purge.conf from browser bookmarks
------------------------------------------------------------

Filename:    wwwofflebook/*
Contributed: <wwm@gmx.ch>

This is a beta version.

> The wwwofflebook scripts can extract the http domains from your browser bookmark
> file. The http domain of a bookmark is the first part of the address, beginning 
> after the protocol prefix 'http://'. wwwofflebook passes these domains to the 
> wwwoffle daemon with the flag to never delete them at all. The pages of this site 
> will always be available offline, from the wwwoffle cache. 
> This way a browser-bookmarked site will be retained until you remove the bookmarks.


Alternative Hyper Estraier indexing script
------------------------------------------

Filename:    eregister/eregister
Contributed: Richard Zidlicky <rz@linux-m68k.org>

>   This script will index a wwwoffle cache and handle incremental
>   updates examining only changed directories and files.
