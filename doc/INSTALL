             WWWOFFLE - Installation Instructions - Version 2.9
             ==================================================


There are only 10 steps required to install WWWOFFLE from the source code to a
fully working and tested program.  If you are using a binary release (Win32)
then you should skip over the first 3 steps.

Compilation
-----------

1) Run the configure script

        ./configure

   You can use the following options:

        --prefix=<dir>                  - Set the installation location
                                          (default is /usr/local/*).

        --with-ipv6, --without-ipv6     - Enable or disable IPv6 support
                                          (default is enabled if IPv6 capable).

        --with-zlib, --without-zlib     - Enable or disable compression support
                                          (default is enabled if zlib is found).

        --with-gnutls, --without-gnutls - Enable or disable SSL/https support
                                          (default is disabled).  Requires
                                          libgcrypt and libgnutls.

        --with-default-language=<lang>  - Set the default language for the
                                          installation (default is en).

        --with-server=<host:port:port:port>  - Set the localhost name, HTTP port
                                          number, WWWOFFLE port number and HTTPS
                                          port number for the programs and
                                          search scripts
                                          (default localhost:8080:8081:8443).

        --with-spooldir=<directory>     - Set the compiled-in default value for
                                          the spool directory (can be overridden
                                          in the configuration file) (default
                                          /var/spool/wwwoffle,
					  /var/cache/wwwoffle is used in Debian)

        --with-confdir=<directory>      - Set the compiled-in default value for
                                          the configuration file directory, (can
                                          be overridden on the command line)
                                          (default /etc/wwwoffle).

        **** Important ****
   To compile WWWOFFLE you will require a C compiler (e.g. gcc) a version of lex
   (e.g. GNU flex) and the appropriate development libraries and include files.
   This is all checked when the configure script is run.
        **** Important ****

2) Compile the programs
     make

3) Install the programs and create the spool directory
     make install

        **** Important ****
   If you already use WWWOFFLE then you should stop the existing version running
   before doing the installation of the new version.
        **** Important ****

        **** Important ****
   The files that are installed by this step should be owned by the user that
   will be running WWWOFFLE (either the user that starts it or the user specified
   in the run-uid and run-gid options in the configuration file.)
        **** Important ****

   You should look out for any output from make that is prefixed with
   'WWWOFFLE:' this is important information and indicates that the installation
   process has found something that requires your action during the install.

   If you want to install the files under a different root directory you can use
   'make install DESTDIR=/some/directory/' to install into '/some/directory'.


Configuration
-------------

4) Edit the configuration file
   wwwoffle.conf

        **** Important * If you must use an external HTTP proxy ****
   You will need to add the name of the proxy and the port number to the Proxy
   section of the configuration file wwwoffle.conf, read it for instructions.
        **** Important * If you must use an external HTTP proxy ****

        **** Important * If you currently use version 2.x ****
    The configuration file wwwoffle.conf has changed, the file CHANGES.CONF
    explains the differences and upgrade-config.pl can fix them.
        **** Important * If you currently use version 2.x ****

5) Start the WWWOFFLE demon running.
   wwwoffled -c wwwoffle.conf

   This may require the full path to the wwwoffled program (usually
   /usr/local/sbin/wwwoffled) and the full path to the configuration file
   (usually /etc/wwwoffle/wwwoffle.conf) if not using the defaules, for example:
   /usr/local/sbin/wwwoffled -c /etc/wwwoffle/wwwoffle.conf

6) Start your web browser and set up localhost:8080 as the proxy.
   Disable caching between sessions within the browser.

   Select the URL http://localhost:8080/ in the browser to test that WWWOFFLE is
   working.

Testing
-------

7) a) Connect to the internet
   b) Tell the WWWOFFLE demon that you are online
        wwwoffle -online
   c) Start browsing
   d) Tell the WWWOFFLE demon that you are offline
        wwwoffle -offline
   e) Disconnect from the internet

8) Go back and browse the pages again while not connected, follow some different
   links this time (you will see a WWWOFFLE server message in the browser).

9) a) Connect to the internet
   b) Tell the WWWOFFLE demon that you are online
        wwwoffle -online
   c) Tell the WWWOFFLE demon to fetch the new pages
        wwwoffle -fetch
   d) Tell the WWWOFFLE demon that you are offline
        wwwoffle -offline
   e) Disconnect from the internet

10)a) Go to http://localhost:8080/index/ and find the newly downloaded pages.
   b) Browse the new pages that have just been fetched.


Making WWWOFFLE Run Automatically
---------------------------------

WWWOFFLE is designed to be easy to automate so that it is always running after
the computer is booted and is always in the correct mode for being connected to
the internet or not.

The contrib/README file contains pointers to various methods of starting
WWWOFFLE automatically and making sure that it is in the correct mode when
online.



Compile Time Options
--------------------

In the file autoconfig.h there are a number of extra compile time options that
you may want to change.  This file is automatically created from autoconfig.h.in
when the configure script is run.


The first five are the compiled in defaults for the options in the StartUp
section of the wwwoffle.conf file.  They are also used as the compiled in
defaults for the wwwoffle program.

/*+ The default localhost name to use for the wwwoffle program. +*/
#define DEF_LOCALHOST "localhost"

/*+ The default port number to use for the http proxy demon. +*/
#define DEF_HTTP_PORT 8080

/*+ The default port number to use for the https proxy demon. +*/
#define DEF_HTTPS_PORT 8443

/*+ The default port number to use for the WWWOFFLE control. +*/
#define DEF_WWWOFFLE_PORT 8081

/*+ The default spool directory. +*/
#define DEF_SPOOLDIR "/var/spool/wwwoffle"

/*+ The default configuration file directory. +*/
#define DEF_CONFDIR "/etc/wwwoffle"


The next four limit the number of connections that wwwoffled will accept at a
time and the number of servers that it will fork in response to this.  A total
of MAX_SERVERS, including up to MAX_FETCH_SERVERS when 'wwwoffle -fetch' is run.
These are options in wwwoffle.conf, but the absolute maximum values can be
changed here as well as the default values.

/*+ The absolute maximum number of servers to fork in total. +*/
#define MAX_SERVERS 64
/*+ The default total number of servers to fork. +*/
#define DEF_MAX_SERVERS 8

/*+ The absolute maximum number of servers to fork for fetching previously
    requested pages. +*/
#define MAX_FETCH_SERVERS 48
/*+ The default number of servers to fork for fetching pages. +*/
#define DEF_MAX_FETCH_SERVERS 4


The next one is the number of prevtime directories that are created to allow a
history back beyond the latest time online.  If this number is changed then the
files /var/cache/wwwoffle/html/*/messages/IndexLastTime-Tail.html and
IndexLastOut-Tail.html must be edited for the links to these to be visible.

/*+ The number of pretime directories to create (lasttime history). +*/
#define NUM_PREVTIME_DIR 7


The next two give the permissions that are used for the creation of directories
and files in the cache (Don't forget the leading '0' for octal).

/*+ The default permission for creating directories. +*/
#define DEF_DIR_PERM  0755
/*+ The default permission for creating files. +*/
#define DEF_FILE_PERM 0644


The rest of the options in the autoconfig.h file are set by the configure script
automatically.
